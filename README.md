# IVS Demo

IVS E-commerce Demo with a Product Carousel and a Simple Chat - https://master.d1ddui0zybgma1.amplifyapp.com/



**This project is intended for education purposes only**

This is a serverless web application leveraging [Amazon IVS](https://aws.amazon.com/ivs/), [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), and [React](https://reactjs.org/). The web user interface is a [single page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) built using [responsive web design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) frameworks and techniques, producing a native app-like experience tailored to the user's device.

This demo showcases how you can implement a product carousel and a simple chat next to an AWS IVS stream.

## Getting Started

1. Run this app locally by pulling down the master branch and calling `yarn start`
2. You can also demo this app by navigating to the AWS Amplify App where this app has been deployed [URL](https://master.d1ddui0zybgma1.amplifyapp.com/)


## Future work
* The application was written for demo purposes and the chat does not support multiple users
* Carousel is accessible but needs more testing
* App needs more unit tests
* Currently only tested in the us-east-1 region
